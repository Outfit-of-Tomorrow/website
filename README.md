# Outfit of Tomorrow Website
##### Live at: https://outfit-of-tomorrow.github.io/website/index.html
### Our Vision
We drive forward the transformation of the fashion industry to become environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable. We believe that we can have a lasting impact by propelling the shift of behaviour that is already taking place.

### Our Mission
We make sustainable fashion available to everyone quickly, easily, and with the right information.

### Our Values
It is at our core to care about the planet and people principally, so we have decided to incorporate a triple bottom line approach. We…
… care for the planet and the people
… collaborate with customers and brands.
… innovate with the consumer in mind.
